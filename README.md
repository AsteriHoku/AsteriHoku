"Sarah leaves an indelible mark on all those fortunate enough to cross her path. The way her mind works is her biggest asset to a potential employer. She will be a wonderful asset to any team." - *Manager*<br><br>
"Excellent communication skills, direct & professional. Honest, friendly, trustworthy and loyal." - *Teammate*<br><br>
"Some people code for the paycheck (nothing wrong with that) and some code because it pulses through their veins and demands to be actualized. These individuals tend to be self-starters, to proactively look for solutions, want to architect the best possible solution (in a timely manner), and are continuously growing their knowledge and experience portfolios.<br>
Sarah is definitely the latter. Give her a project and she will run with it. Show her a problem and she will find a solution. Challenges energize her. I have seen her be handed ridiculous challenges, persist in spite of the difficulties, and conquer them. I’ve seen her persevere even when the team didn’t show up for her. I’ve seen her dive into new topics and come out on top at a speed that amazes me. In addition to her technical skills Sarah is someone who befriends everyone and genuinely cares about their wellbeing. She is a team builder, eager to learn and to share. If I was building a team, I’d want her on it." - *Teammate*
